She recently revealed that out of the 49 million Ugandans, only about 35,000 people have access to public funds and can make decisions. They are the ones who steal over 10 trillion each year. They are the ones who have turned Uganda into one of the most corrupt countries in the world. They are the ones who have ensured we have no functional schools, hospitals, or factories. They are the ones responsible for the mass exodus of young unemployed Ugandans who go to Arab countries to serve as maids. They are the ones who have ensured we have no infrastructure to speak about. They are the ones who send the impoverished military and police to beat up anti-corruption activists. A small clique that continues to steal and destroy the future of millions!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:20px\">Ladies and gentlemen, as we face the Kawempe North election and next year&#8217;s election, we are asking the people of Uganda where they fall. One has to be amongst the 49 million oppressed taxpayers or part of the 35,000 oppressors. (And the number of the oppressors is even smaller because not all the 35,000 approve of this mess). Every Ugandan will have a choice on which side to belong!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-id=\"16630\" src=\"https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/photo_2025-03-12_15-09-59-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/photo_2025-03-12_15-09-59-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/photo_2025-03-12_15-09-59-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/photo_2025-03-12_15-09-59-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/photo_2025-03-12_15-09-59.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"16631\" src=\"https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIHyXoAAxb_3-1-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16631\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIHyXoAAxb_3-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIHyXoAAxb_3-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIHyXoAAxb_3-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIHyXoAAxb_3-1-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIHyXoAAxb_3-1.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"16632\" src=\"https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIDfXQAE2p30-1-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16632\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIDfXQAE2p30-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIDfXQAE2p30-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIDfXQAE2p30-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIDfXQAE2p30-1-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/GliGIDfXQAE2p30-1.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our message to the people of Kawempe North today was drawn from the words of IGG Betty Kamya.
