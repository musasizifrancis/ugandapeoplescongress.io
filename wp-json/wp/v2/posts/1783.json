In addition, the Ugandan regime is now considered illegitimate by most Ugandans.<\/p>\n<p>On January 14, 2021, dictator Museveni lost a Presidential election \u2014 54.19% to 34.83% per independent tallies \u2014 to principal challenger, Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu (aka Bobi Wine), though Museveni\u2019s handpicked electoral commission declared him winner. The fraudulent declaration is currently being challenged in the East African Court of Justice with supporting evidence that was declined by a partisan Uganda Supreme Court.<\/p>\n<p>It would be unconscionable for the IMF to allocate more funds to a regime so riddled with endemic corruption that the almost $1 billion that IMF, World Bank &amp; other international donors allocated to Uganda in 2020 for Covid relief was either embezzled or misdirected towards military suppression of opposition political party supporters.<\/p>\n<p>Some covid funds were channeled to Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa\u2019s two daughters\u2019 company which was awarded a contract to deliver Oxygen to Uganda\u2019s hospitals, but failed to do so.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ugandans died (in 2020) and continue to die (June 2021) of Covid-19 due to lack of oxygen in hospitals.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.monitor.co.ug\/uganda\/news\/national\/investigation-how-lack-of-oxygen-poor-health-sector-is-killing-covid-19-patients-in-uganda-3213300\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.monitor.co.ug\/uganda\/news\/national\/investigation-how-lack-of-oxygen-poor-health-sector-is-killing-covid-19-patients-in-uganda-3213300<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa has himself been implicated in various corruption scandals in Uganda.

Runaway corruption in Uganda is not due to a lack of a leadership code. Uganda has had a leadership code act since 2002,<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ugandalaws.com\/principal-legislation\/leadership-code-act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.ugandalaws.com\/principal-legislation\/leadership-code-act<\/a><\/p>\n<p>but it has had no effect on corruption because corrupt officials are intricately linked to Museveni and his kin. Museveni also fuels corruption by openly bribing members of parliament whenever he wants to pass controversial legislation such as the removal of the age limit clause from the constitution in 2017.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-uganda-politics\/ugandan-mps-get-8000-each-for-work-on-extending-presidents-rule-spokesman-idUSKBN1CT1J6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-uganda-politics\/ugandan-mps-get-8000-each-for-work-on-extending-presidents-rule-spokesman-idUSKBN1CT1J6<\/a><\/p>\n<p>There is no new substantive leadership code. Museveni simply just announced a \u201cleadership-code tribunal.\u201d Experience shows that such announcements are merely stratagems that Museveni uses to appear to be addressing international and domestic calls for action.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mediacentre.go.ug\/media\/president-museveni-swears-new-leadership-code-tribunal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.mediacentre.go.ug\/media\/president-museveni-swears-new-leadership-code-tribunal<\/a><\/p>\n<p>According to the press release\u2019s FAQ section:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe [Uganda] Government has already completed the audit of COVID-19 spending for FY 19\/20, which is expected to be published in the coming days. Some aggregate procurement reports have already been published and individual procurement contracts will also be published in the next few days.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Countries\/UGA\/uganda-qandas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Countries\/UGA\/uganda-qandas<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Question: Why did the International Monetary Fund reach an agreement with the Ugandan regime on the ECF before publication of its audit of Covid-19 spending? And why only FY 19\/20? Much of the Covid-19 related fraud transpired in FY 20\/21 (1 July 2020 \u2013 June 30, 2021)?<\/p>\n<p>The Political and Human Rights situation in Uganda<\/p>\n<p>Beyond financial and economic aspects, the dire political and human rights situation in Uganda is enough reason to hold off on approving the ECF to the Uganda regime which is considered illegitimate by most Ugandans \u2014 outside of a tiny business elite and regime beneficiaries. Aware of the population\u2019s sentiments, General Museveni has since the election in January 2021, escalated abductions, torture, and murder of opposition party supporters in a bid to eliminate evidence of his electoral fraud \u2014 and to cower the population into not protesting it. On November 18, 2020, during the campaign period, Ugandan security forces shot dead more than 100 citizens protesting the arrest of Presidential candidate, Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, though the officially acknowledged count is 54 people.<\/p>\n<p>BBC documentary on the November Killings committed by Uganda Security Forces<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our Diaspora Leadership Team has written this letter to the Managing Director of IMF over plans to yet again extend over 1 billion dollars to the regime.
