Hon. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mpuugamathias.com\/\">Mathias Mpuuga Nasamba<\/a>, has this afternoon wished a happy Eid-Al-Adhuha to the Muslim community of Uganda ahead of their celebrations tomorrow. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Below is his full message. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><strong>E<\/strong>id-al-Adhuha reminds us of the devotion and faith of Prophet Ibrahim to the Almighty Allah that, centuries later, he is still revered by both Muslims and Christians as the grandfather of believers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">On this day, our Muslim brothers are encouraged to perform an important ritual of offering a sacrificial animal in remembrance of the Prophet Ibrahim\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his son, Ismail, for the sake of Allah. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Unfortunately, many of them will not be able to fulfill this act of worship due to the escalating commodity prices. The high prices, matched with rising poverty levels, also mean that many families will not share the joy of Eid because they can\u2019t afford the basics of life. The high fuel prices have made it difficult for others to travel to the countryside to celebrate Eid with their families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">While we may urge those with provisions to share them with those in need, it is shameful that for almost six months now, the government has failed to address the runaway prices of essential products. A cut in taxes and the regime\u2019s appetite for expenditure on non-essential priorities can bring down the prices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">As we remember Prophet Ibrahim\u2019s devotion, we should not forget our comrades who have spent years in incarceration and those who paid the ultimate price because of their political belief that this country deserves better. Let\u2019s keep our hope for a new Uganda alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16229\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga-120x120.jpg 120w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga-270x270.jpg 270w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga-60x60.jpg 60w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga-70x70.jpg 70w, https:\/\/nupuganda.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Hon.-Mpuuga.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Eid Mubarak<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Mathias Mpuuga Nsamba (MP)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Deputy President of the National Unity Platform for the central region and also the Leader of Opposition in the Ugandan Parliament, Rt.
